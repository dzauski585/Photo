<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<img src="images/Screenshot 9_19_2023 3_43_41 PM.png" alt="Home Page" >

This is a photography website for an amateur to beginner professional photographer. There is a main page which includes a hero and about me section. Further down the page is a slide show that incorporates recent works. Finally an instagram scraper pulls the six most recent posts to the home page to keep content current. Headers and footers are also seen with navigation and social media links.
